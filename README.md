## Talks

### **Implementing APIs with Flask + OpenAPI** 

#### Speaker: [Albert Suarez](https://github.com/AlbertSuarez)

This talk has the goal of introducing the concept of how to build an API using Flask and OpenAPI. Using Python, we are gonna learn how to interact with a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy, building the project using Connexion and learning what ReDoc is.

### **Intro to React with TypeScript** 

#### Speaker: [David Aleu](https://github.com/daleu)

The goal of this talk is to learn how to create a web application using React with Typescript. In addition, you will learn some useful libraries that could help you when you are developing a web application with React.

### **Setting up Docker-Compose w/ nginx + ReactJS + uWSGI + PostgreSQL**

#### Speaker: [Alaa Moucharrafie](https://github.com/alaamouch)

In this workshop you'll learn how to set up a production-ready environment that spins up the API server developed by Albert Suarez (accessed through uWSGI), the PostgreSQL database that the API queries to, the web client developed by David Aleu (ReactJS) and a reverse proxy (nginx) that will serve as an entrypoint to the project.
